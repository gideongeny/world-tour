- âœ… Added `json` import to `new_models.py`

### 3. **Production Configuration**
- âœ… Updated app to use environment variables for SECRET_KEY
- âœ… Fixed app initialization for production (host and port)
- âœ… Database relationships fixed (foreign keys added)

### 4. **Application Testing**
- âœ… App imports successfully without errors
- âœ… All models are properly defined
- âœ… Database relationships are correctly configured

## ðŸŽ¯ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **What's Working:**
- âœ… Flask application starts without errors
- âœ… All SQLAlchemy models are properly defined
- âœ… Database relationships are correctly configured
- âœ… Production database configuration is set up
- âœ… Environment variables are configured
- âœ… Render deployment configuration is ready

### **Next Steps for Deployment:**

1. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment - Fix database and imports"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Render
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
   - The PostgreSQL database will be created automatically
   - Environment variables will be set automatically

3. **Environment Variables (Set in Render Dashboard):**
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a secure random key (e.g., use Python's `secrets` module)
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Will be set automatically by Render
   - `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production`

4. **Post-Deployment:**
   - Monitor the deployment logs in Render dashboard
   - Test the application once deployed
   - Check that the database is properly initialized

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If you encounter issues:**

1. **Database Connection Errors:**
   - Check that `DATABASE_URL` is properly set in Render
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible

2. **Import Errors:**
   - All required imports have been added
   - Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`

3. **Model Errors:**
   - All foreign key relationships are properly defined
   - Database tables will be created automatically

## ðŸ“Š **Current Status**

**âœ… READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The application is now properly configured for production deployment on Render. All critical issues have been resolved:

- Database configuration supports both development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL)
- All missing imports have been added
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Render deployment configuration is complete

**Expected deployment time:** 2-5 minutes
**Expected result:** Fully functional World Tour website on Render
